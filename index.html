    <p>Timothy Walter Burton[a] (born August 25, 1958) is an American film director, producer, writer, and artist. He is
        best known for his gothic fantasy and horror films such as Beetlejuice (1988), Edward Scissorhands (1990), The
        Nightmare Before Christmas (1993), Ed Wood (1994), Sleepy Hollow (1999), Corpse Bride (2005), Sweeney Todd: The
        Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007), Frankenweenie (2012), the superhero films Batman (1989) and Batman Returns
        (1992), the sci-fi film Planet of the Apes (2001), the fantasy-drama Big Fish (2003), the musical adventure film
        Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005), and the fantasy films Alice in Wonderland (2010) and Miss Peregrine's
        Home for Peculiar Children (2016).

        Burton has often worked with actor Johnny Depp and composer Danny Elfman, who has composed scores for all but
        three of the films Burton has directed. Helena Bonham Carter, Burton's former domestic partner, has appeared in
        many of his films. He wrote and illustrated the poetry book The Melancholy Death of Oyster Boy & Other Stories,
        published in 1997 by British publishing house Faber and Faber, and a compilation of his drawings, sketches, and
        other artwork, entitled The Art of Tim Burton, was released in 2009. A follow-up to that book, entitled The
        Napkin Art of Tim Burton: Things You Think About in a Bar, containing sketches made by Burton on napkins at bars
        and restaurants he visited, was released in 2015.</p>

    <p>From November 22, 2009, to April 26, 2010, Burton had a retrospective at the MoMA in New York with over 700
        "drawings, paintings, photographs, storyboards, moving-image works, puppets, maquettes, costumes and cinematic
        ephemera", including many from the filmmaker's personal collection.

        From MoMA, the "Tim Burton" exhibition traveled directly to Australian Centre for the Moving Image in Melbourne.
        Running from June 24 to October 10, 2010, the ACMI exhibition incorporated additional material from Burton's
        Alice in Wonderland, which was released in March 2010.

        "The Art of Tim Burton" was exhibited at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art from May 29 to October 31, 2011,
